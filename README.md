## Fixed bugs

- The issue with the small screen was that the logo was not fitting properly. After removing padding and margin-left, the issue was resolved.
- When adding animation to the logo, it was not showing in the center for smaller screens. This was resolved by adding a line of code to the logo in style.css, and then using Dev tools to identify and fix the problem, which provided a better understanding of how to address it.
